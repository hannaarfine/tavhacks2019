# The Cornell Code of Academic Integrity

<https://cuinfo.cornell.edu/aic.cfm>

A Cornell student's submission of work for academic credit indicates that the work is the student's own. All outside assistance should be acknowledged, and the student's academic position truthfully reported at all times. In addition, Cornell students have a right to expect academic integrity from each of their peers.

## General Responsibilities
1. A student shall in no way misrepresent his or her work.
2. A student shall in no way fraudulently or unfairly advance his or her academic position.
3. A student shall refuse to be a party to another student's failure to maintain academic integrity.
4. A student shall not in any other manner violate the principle of academic integrity.

## Submission Instructions

4. **Stage your changes.**

6. **Push your changes to GitHub.**

Note: Forgetting to commit, push, or check your assignment before the deadline is not a valid excuse for submitting late.
